Description: 
    Creates a virtual pointer for R's ALTREP object which does not 
    have the data allocates in memory. The pointer is made by the file 
    mapping of a virtual file so it behaves exactly the same as a regular
    pointer. All the requests to access the pointer will be sent to the 
    underlying file system and eventually handled by a customized 
    data-reading function. 
    The main purpose of the package is to reduce the memory consumption when
    using R's vector to represent a large data. The use cases of the package 
    include on-disk data representation, compressed vector(e.g. RLE) and etc.
